*1. The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.*

	So we want to create a general discord bot someone could implement into their server to help do a variety of tasks. Our minimum viable product would be to create a bot that can do moderation commands (like kick, ban, mute, etc), a ticket system that will save a transcript as a text file, and uses a variety of APIs to get cat memes and funny jokes. Our stretch goal would be to use a database such as MongoDB for that ticket system, along with incorporating ChatGPT API so that the bot can be conversational. We would also like to implement a sales data module where the bot will prompt you for sales and cogs data, and it will output into an Excel/Google sheet the information nicely formatted for easy tracking.

*2. Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.*

	As a team, we want to better understand how we can create a bot that other people can use on a different platform, much like how you made a Telegram bot. We want it to be as user-friendly as possible and want to design it in such a way that the bot can explain to the user what its functionalities are. 

	Individually (Jacob), I am very interested in learning more about outputting data into files (excel and text docs). I want to be able to carry over this data manipulation and reformatting into my own business ventures, where it can be very difficult to track sales data. I am also very interested in exploring the ChatGPT API as I do believe that AI is quite literally the future, and knowing how to utilize this API in the workspace could give me an edge over any competition I may have.

I (Bidhi) am fairly new to the Discord space. So I am pretty excited to learn more about the platform and its functionalities and what we can particularly achieve by building a bot. I am also excited to go through the bot development process. It’ll help me get more familiar with API and web requests. Apart from the technicalities, I am also excited to strengthen my problem-solving and collaboration skills. 

*3. Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.*

	We are planning to research and identify different features that we can implement in the bot and then create a framework for the project. This can be done by analyzing our goals for the project and looking at other existing bots for inspiration. Once we have the framework in place, we will start writing the code and create an MVP. From there we are planning to add layers to the prototype, run tests, get feedback, and make changes to the project accordingly. We are planning to use various libraries and APIs to do so. 

*4. Schedule: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. The preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.*

*5. Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.*
	We are planning to schedule a series of time blocks to work together with each other either in person or virtually. We are leaning towards dividing the task and then incorporating them separately for now but we are also open to comprehensive pair programming if need be. One of the good options available to us is Liveshare, which will allow us to work on the project at the same time. To ensure effective team collaboration we’ll meet twice every week, once, in the beginning, to make sure that we have further broken down the tasks and assigned them to each other and at the end of the week to make sure we conclude properly. The concluding meeting will focus on summarizing the tasks and discussing what went well and what can be improved. We have also discussed being open to communication with each other. We are working in a short time frame but we are definitely interested in implementing agile software development. 


*6. Risks and Limitations: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?*
	The major risk that we have for this project is not being able to communicate with each other. Not asking for help from you if needed, and leaving everything for the last minute. We’ll start the project with those risks in mind. We can set some expectations beforehand to make sure that we are delivering on our responsibilities and meeting the goals set for each other. 


*7. Additional Course Content: What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project?*

	Apart from the topics covered in the class, developing a Discord bot will require us to work with the Discord API as well as ChatGPT API. We will be required to interact with the Discord servers, channels, and users. We also believe that learning how to use the openpyxl library will be greatly useful in our project. Error handling will also be greatly helpful.
